## 📖 Overview

**Sims 4 Integrity Auditor** is a desktop application designed to help Sims 4 players and modders verify the integrity of their game installation. It scans critical game folders, calculates SHA-256 hashes for each file, and generates both human-readable text reports and a comprehensive JSON export for automated verification.

### Why Use This Tool?

- 🔍 **Verify Game Files**: Ensure your Sims 4 installation hasn't been corrupted or modified
- 🛡️ **Mod Safety**: Create snapshots before and after installing mods
- 📊 **Documentation**: Generate detailed reports of your game state
