## 📖 Overview

**Sims 4 String Relocator** is a specialized tool for The Sims 4 modders and translators that automatically extracts and organizes language string files (`.package` files) from your game installation. It intelligently scans both base game and DLC content, separating strings by language into organized folder structures.

### Why Use This Tool?

- 🌐 **Translation Work**: Easy access to all language strings for translation projects
- 🔧 **Mod Development**: Quick extraction of string files for custom content creation
- 📦 **Organization**: Automatically sorts files by language and maintains folder hierarchy
- 🚀 **Automation**: One-click extraction of all languages at once
- 🎨 **Bilingual Interface**: Switch between English and Spanish on the fly

## 📤 Output

### Folder Structure

The tool creates an organized hierarchy preserving the original game structure:

```
Strings/
├── ENG_US/
│   ├── Data/
│   │   └── Client/
│   │       └── Strings_ENG_US.package
│   └── Delta/
│       ├── EP01/
│       │   └── Strings_ENG_US.package
│       ├── GP03/
│       │   └── Strings_ENG_US.package
│       └── ...
├── SPA_EA/
│   ├── Data/
│   │   └── Client/
│   │       └── Strings_SPA_EA.package
│   └── Delta/
│       └── ...
├── FRE_FR/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Detected Languages

The tool automatically detects all installed language packages. Common languages include:

| Code | Language |
|------|----------|
| `ENG_US` | English (US) |
| `SPA_EA` | Spanish |
| `FRE_FR` | French |
| `GER_DE` | German |
| `ITA_IT` | Italian |
| `JPN_JP` | Japanese |
| `KOR_KR` | Korean |
| `POL_PL` | Polish |
| `POR_BR` | Portuguese (Brazil) |
| `RUS_RU` | Russian |
| `CHI_CN` | Chinese (Simplified) |
| `CHI_TW` | Chinese (Traditional) |

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Detection Process

1. **Scans** `Data/Client` for `Strings_*.package` files
2. **Identifies** all language codes from filenames
3. **Searches** recursively through:
   - `Data/Client` - Base game strings
   - `Delta` - All DLC string files (EP*, GP*, SP*, FP*)
4. **Copies** files while preserving directory structure
5. **Organizes** by language into separate folders

### File Naming Convention

The Sims 4 uses this naming pattern for language files:
```
Strings_{LANGUAGE_CODE}.package
```

Example: `Strings_ENG_US.package`, `Strings_SPA_EA.package`

---

## 🎨 Use Cases

### 1. Translation Projects
```
Extract all Spanish strings → Modify translations → Repackage
```

### 2. Mod Development
```
Extract base game strings → Reference for custom content → Create compatible mods
```

### 3. Language Comparison
```
Extract multiple languages → Compare translations → Quality assurance
```

### 4. Backup & Archive
```
Extract before game update → Archive language versions → Restore if needed
```

## 🖥️ Technical Details

### File Operations

- **Method**: Uses Python's `shutil.copy2` to preserve file metadata
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintains relative paths from game directory
- **Overwrite Safety**: Creates new directories as needed without overwriting existing files
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS (with Path library)

### Performance

- **Speed**: Processes files as fast as your disk I/O allows
- **Memory Efficient**: Copies files one at a time
- **Non-Destructive**: Original game files remain untouched
- **Typical Time**: 30 seconds - 2 minutes (depending on DLC count)

---

## 🌍 Supported Languages

The application interface supports:

- 🇬🇧 **English** (EN)
- 🇪🇸 **Spanish** (ES)

The tool can extract **any language** that The Sims 4 supports, regardless of the UI language selected.

### Ideas for Contributions

- [ ] Add more UI languages (French, German, etc.)
- [ ] Implement file comparison between language versions
- [ ] Add progress bar for extraction process
- [ ] Create package merger (combine multiple string files)
- [ ] Add string search and filter functionality
- [ ] Implement diff viewer for translation changes
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple game installations
- [ ] Create CLI version for automation scripts

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No languages detected"

**Solution**: Verify your game path points to the root Sims 4 directory (should contain `Data` and `Delta` folders)

### Issue: Permission denied

**Solution**: Run as administrator or choose an output folder where you have write permissions

### Issue: Missing DLC strings

**Solution**: Ensure all DLC is properly installed and the Delta folder contains the respective expansion pack folders
